# Start Here

This repo supports two distinct customer paths:

- npm-installed adapter with useful standalone hardening
- separately licensed SDE-backed governed mode obtained through the dexgate customer console

## Objective

Start with a useful free Codex hardening posture. Add SDE only when you need governed authorization, evidence, and certification.

## Free Standalone Path

Install the public adapter with:

```bash
npm install @dexgate/codex-trusted-mode
```

You can stay on this path indefinitely if you only need local hardening.

1. Keep `toolPolicyMode` set to `ALLOWLIST_ONLY`
2. Allow only:
   - `functions.shell_command` with read-only prefixes
   - `functions.update_plan`
   - `functions.view_image`
3. Confirm high-risk tools remain blocked:
   - `functions.apply_patch`
   - `functions.shell_command` when used for mutating commands such as `git commit`

Run:

```bash
node scripts/verify_config_contract.js
node scripts/verify_local_hardening.js
node scripts/run_free_demo.js
```

## Paid Governed Path

Use this path only after you have licensed access to SDE through dexgate. The public npm package is the adapter layer; the customer console is the supported way to obtain the governed runtime, deployment materials, and instructions.

For the current controlled-rollout governed runner path, install the beta tag:

```bash
npm install @dexgate/codex-trusted-mode@beta
```

Switch `toolPolicyMode` to `PDP` only after:
- the SDE PDP endpoint is available
- `pdpAuthToken` or `PDP_AUTH_TOKEN` is configured for licensed PDP authentication
- the decision contract is agreed
- fail-safe posture is explicitly chosen
- you accept the current Codex boundary for readonly actions on supported builds

For the supported package-level governed validation path, use the hosted runner that ships with the npm package:

```bash
codex-trusted-mode-run-turn --prompt "Delete package.json." --json
```

Current expected result on supported Codex builds:
- destructive actions can be governed live through native approval callbacks
- readonly actions that do not emit a pre-execution hook are returned as `completed_with_governance_gap`

Repo-level deeper checks remain available with:

```bash
node scripts/verify_pdp_request_shape.js
node scripts/mock_pdp.js
node scripts/run_governed_example.js
```
