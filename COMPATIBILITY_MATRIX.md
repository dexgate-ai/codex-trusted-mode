# Compatibility Matrix

## Purpose

Track which Codex versions and delivery surfaces are validated for the governed integration.

## Current State

The observed Codex tool surface and native app-server approval surface have been documented. The current public launch boundary is narrower than OpenClaw and should be read accordingly.

| Codex Surface / Version | Adapter Version | Certification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validated current workspace session | 0.1.8 | CERTIFIED_ENFORCED | Validated observed current workspace session only. |
| next candidate version | 0.1.8 | LOCKDOWN_ONLY | Retest before broader enforced claims. |
| latest (rolling) | 0.1.8 | UNSUPPORTED | Treat as uncertified until explicitly validated. |

## Policy

- `CERTIFIED_ENFORCED` requires validated request shape and native pre-execution enforcement behavior for the claimed surface
- `LOCKDOWN_ONLY` means local hardening and constrained governed claims are available, but broad pre-execution governed-enforcement claims are not made
- `UNSUPPORTED` means no claims are made

## Controlled-Rollout Release Gate

The current public Codex offering should not be described as full parity with OpenClaw.

Minimum bar for the current controlled rollout:
- destructive-action native approval callback evidence exists
- hosted-runner deny path is validated against the target SDE runtime
- readonly no-hook cases are surfaced as governance gaps rather than false green passes

Promotion beyond the current boundary requires:
- native readonly pre-execution hook validation on the claimed Codex build
- repeated evidence on the claimed host platforms
- a refreshed matrix row for the exact adapter/runtime combination being promoted
